📊 **Quality Control Dashboard – Power BI Project**

📌 **Overview**

This project presents a Quality Control Dashboard built using Power BI to analyze production data and identify defect patterns. The dashboard helps monitor product quality, track defect trends, and evaluate performance across production lines and inspectors.

🎯 Objectives

Calculate and visualize the Overall Defect Rate
Identify Top Defective Products
Analyze Defect Trends Over Time
Evaluate defects by Production Line and Inspector
Enable interactive filtering using date slicers

📂**Dataset Description**

🔹 **Production Data**

Date – Production date

ProductID – Unique product identifier

BatchID – Batch reference

Status – Pass / Fail

🔹**Batch Data**

BatchID – Unique batch identifier
ProductionLine – Manufacturing line
InspectorName – Quality inspector

🔗 **Data Modeling**

Established a Many-to-One relationship between:

Followed star schema approach (no table merging)

📊**Dashboard Features**

🔹 **KPI Cards**

Total Items
Defective Items
Overall Defect Rate
Daily Defect Rate

🔹 **Visualizations**

📌 Top 5 Products by Defect Count (Bar Chart)
📈 Defect Rate Trend Over Time (Line Chart)
📋 Defects by Production Line & Inspector (Matrix)
🔹 Interactivity
📅 Date Slicer to filter all visuals dynamically

🧠 **Key Insights**

The overall defect rate is approximately 6%, indicating stable production quality.
Product 3 has the highest defect count and requires further investigation.
Certain inspectors are associated with more defects, highlighting potential quality gaps.
Line C shows relatively higher defect occurrences.
A slight upward trend in defects is observed toward the later dates.

🛠 **Tools Used**

Power BI Desktop
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
Data Modeling (Star Schema)

📌 **Conclusion**

This dashboard provides actionable insights into product quality and helps identify areas for process improvement, enabling better decision-making in manufacturing operations.
